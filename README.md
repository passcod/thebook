This was about a boy who wakes up from an accident blind,
and I believe the original idea was to explore both his new life and the world he now sees,
that he calls "blanck".

Perhaps some case could be made that this partially came from my own deteriorating eyesight,
but I'm more inclined to say it was the particular spelling of the word blanck and a want to write a story around that.
