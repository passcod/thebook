### Pinim ###

I am worried about Lucyn. As ever, he smiles, plays, and jokes - and oh do we
laugh! - but sometimes I see his eyes blur, and his smile strain, and even if
he laughs away any of my inquiries, saying 'Eh, Pinim, I think *your* eyes 
are funny!' I think he hides something, a pain, a wound, something happening 
to his eyes. But what?

I fear I might not discover that until it's too late. But Lucyn shouldn't hide
anything from us, we're his friends, after all! I'll talk to the others, maybe
they know something.

<br />

### Lucyn ###

That set me off. I did not think that it was that obvious, and maybe it is more
serious than I care to think. It's been months that I read Pinim's diary, to
see what she thinks of Ale... we all know Ale likes her, more than he cares to
say, except Pinim, who, strangely, seems not to notice. And her diary is no
more eloquent. But still, I hope that one day she'll see through her glasses, 
and discover Ale's eyes are shining.

However, today I realised she was busier looking at my eyes. Blurring? That's
something new. Or maybe it was there since the beginning, only I didn't realise
 - after all, it never happens in front of a mirror.

If it is that serious that people are starting to see it out in the open, then
it means there is something wrong. I need to talk about it... but how am I 
going to explain why I didn't share it earlier?

Tonight is Luma's birthday, tomorrow is another day, the day after will be too
late... I need time I haven't; but I'll sleep on it and see tomorrow.

Hopefully.

### Shvn ###

I must have been sleeping for too long, because I was hungry when I stood up.
But as much as I'd like to eat, Zvm made sure I didn't get any before I'd done
the daily ritual. It is the 93rd day into my Vweke, and the end is still very
far away - given that I can pass the challenges ahead, which is not given at
all!

I need to eat now, and to sleep again.
