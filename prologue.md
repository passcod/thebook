Blanck
=======

I'm going blind.

I might even never see again: right now, all I can see is blanck, all that dark
bright black blank landscape. It's happened before, but never this long... or 
has it? It's difficult to estimate time in blanck: with only my thoughts 
around, I could have been like that for ten seconds, ten minutes... ten hours.

You probably wonder how I came to be like that. It's a long story, but if you 
don't mind staying around for a little while, I will show you.

For now, if you could help me, I would be so ever grateful. Move a bit around,
make yourself comfortable. This could take a little while.
