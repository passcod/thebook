*__53.47.2__ Day of Salt*

Today, nearly 4 years since it began, is the first time I have enjoyed the
Day of Salt in the Red City of Ominelga. It is a time of reunion, of sadness
and joy, of remembering before the celebrating, of salt tasting and salt
burning. It is a day when the children will run and laugh, the grown-ups smile
and joke. It is a happy day.

Four years ago, we were sailing up the River, in the middle of the night, late.
We were silent and anxious, and excited and restless. We had missed the tide
and now had to break the water fast, as fast as we could, to arrive at the quay
before the earliest bird sang.

Four years ago, we were in the Blue City of Abelfa, resting after that lone
racing, waiting impatiently the morning, the sun, the song of the earliest bird.

Four years ago, we were running and crying and shouting and laughing and joking
and pushing and pulling and sitting and standing and showing and watching and
listening and talking and eating and drinking and having a good Day of Salt.

It was before.

I will not describe the Day of Salt. It is not right. Such happiness should not
be tainted by the times later.

We had a good time, oblivious as we were. But it began then; it was the beginning
of the beginning, and I shall begin. What happened happened...

*... the next day.*
