Writing Diary
=============

10.22.6
-------

Rewrote the prologue. It changes the focus considerably, but the last week I 
spent imagining the book, reshaping it and making the story more complex, 
more alive.

You know, L&eacute;a, I finally chose: it will be 3b+2g. A simple choice because the
central character is a he... the blind boy of the prologue.

There's still not much to be read, but that will come soon. I am more ready 
than ever to write, and the only lacking item is time.

I think I'm gonna begin Chapter 1 now... 



10.20.3
-------

Three weeks have passed since I last wrote here. But I have not
been inactive in this regard for the last 21 days. I have been
imagining.

I had the basic idea when I started. But now I've got to immerge myself in this
universe I have been creating. Why? Well, it's very simple: my characters will
see, think, speak and act in the way they've always done... all their life, even
they do not exist yet!

I'll also rewrite the prologue. I actually wrote the first one to give me a
starting point, because I felt that if I didn't write anything, I'd give up the
idea entirely, without even having begun.

Anyways, I know *nobody* reads what I write right now, I'm writing it for those
who, later on, will read this diary.

And also for me.


10.16.7
-------

I've written the prologue earlier in the afternoon. It's basically a diary
entry, 4 years into the future. The irony is it doesn't say anything except
that something *will* happen in 49\. In fact, it precises the date of the
first day (the first chapter) to be 49.47.9\.

I've thought about the title (if I'm not keeping "The Book I Dreamt Of", of
course). Nothing geniously great has popped up, but there is that one: "A 
Tahlr Tale". The first two words are a pun, except you won't look for it in
the right language: the words are English, but the pun is French. It's not a
pun to properly speak, English teachers will call it a *Mondegreen*. Those
first two words can be made into "&Agrave; t'&agrave; l'heure", which is short
for "&Agrave; tout &agrave; l'heure", which is french for "See you later". Not
great, but still.

For this to work, I have to precise the pronounciation of Tahlr. It's TAH-LER.
The *a* as in sp*a*, and the *er* as in pott*er*, mann*er*s, read*er*. I hope
you understand.

The (real) title will be determined much later, of course...

One last thing: I need to think about the names of the four main characters --
2b + 2g, and the last one we'll see when he/she appears.



P.S: Oh, and remind me to look up old and made up languages to create the
origins of the word (and the country) Tahlr.
