Writing Diary
=============

10.16.7
-------

I've written the prologue earlier in the afternoon. It's basically a diary
entry, 4 years into the future. The irony is it doesn't say anything except
that something *will* happen in 49\. In fact, it precises the date of the
first day (the first chapter) to be 49.47.9\.

I've thought about the title (if I'm not keeping "The Book I Dreamt Of", of
course). Nothing geniously great has popped up, but there is that one: "A 
Tahlr Tale". The first two words are a pun, except you won't look for it in
the right language: the words are English, but the pun is French. It's not a
pun to properly speak, English teachers will call it a *Mondegreen*. Those
first two words can be made into "&Agrave; t'&agrave; l'heure", which is short
for "&Agrave; tout &agrave; l'heure", which is french for "See you later". Not
great, but still.

For this to work, I have to precise the pronounciation of Tahlr. It's TAH-LER.
The *a* as in sp*a*, and the *er* as in pott*er*, mann*er*s, read*er*. I hope
you understand.

The (real) title will be determined much later, of course...

One last thing: I need to think about the names of the four main characters --
2b + 2g, and the last one we'll see when he/she appears.

<br />

P.S: Oh, and remind me to look up old and made up languages to create the
origins of the word (and the country) Tahlr.
