The Book I Dreamt Of
====================

Pronounciation
--------------

#### Of names and other words native to Talhr ####

Each letter has its sound, like Spanish or French. Or latin.

The usual pronounciation rules apply, except:

- 'y' is pronounced 'ya', or 'yah', with the French 'a', but short and almost
  non-spoken.
- 'u' is the french 'u' or latin 'y'.
- 'e' is the latin 'e', or the french '&eacute;', and can be approached by the
  english 'ay', as in 'May', or 'eh'. "Ale" is __not__ pronouced like the beverage, but
  a bit like 'Al-eh'.

Language
--------

It will be written in English at the base, but I may write a French translation
as I go.

The characters and places in this work of fiction are fictionous, but they are

that this novel is a work of fiction and none of it is real; it may be based on
real facts, but, as a whole, it is actually fictional.
