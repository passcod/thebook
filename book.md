Disclaimer
----------

The characters and places in this work of fiction are fictionous, but they are based on real
experiences, and therefore on real people and places. However, the fictional places and peoples
have no ties to their real counterparts, so I cannot be held liable because anyone feels I have
offended them writing something about them or a place in this novel, as I have clearly stated
above that this novel is a work of fiction and none of it is real; it may be based on real facts,
but, as a whole, it is actually fictional.
