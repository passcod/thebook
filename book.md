The Book I Dreamt Of
====================

Pronunciation
--------------

#### Of names and other words native to Talhr ####

Each letter has its sound, like Spanish or French. Or latin.

The usual pronunciation rules apply, except:

- 'y' is pronounced 'ya', or 'yah', with the French 'a', but short and almost
  non-spoken.
- 'u' is the french 'u' or latin 'y'.
- 'e' is the latin 'e', or the french '&eacute;', and can be approached by the
  english 'ay', as in 'May', or 'eh'. "Ale" is *not* pronounced like the
  beverage, but a bit like 'Ah-l-eh'.
- 'v', in Shvn's language, is pronounced 'uh'. In other languages, it is the
  normal 'v'. "Shvn" is thus pronounced a bit like the English name Sean, and
  like the verb 'to shun'.
- 'hr' is 'er', as in 'butter'. The 'h' is not pronounced.

Characters
----------

Our five heroes are:

- *Lucyn*
- *Pinim*
- *Ale*
- *Luma*
- *???*

and there is the mysterious *Shvn*.

Language
--------

It will be written in English at the base, but I may write a French translation
as I go.
